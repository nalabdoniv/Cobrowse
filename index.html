							<h2>Integration</h2>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
							<li><p><b>Workspace Web Edition — </b> Genesys Co-browse can be integrated and accessed from Workspace Web Edition, which provides the agent the ability to join and terminate a co-browsing session with a customer.</p></li>
							<li><p><b>Workspace Desktop Edition  - </b> The Genesys Co-browse Plug-in for Workspace Desktop Edition is required to interface Genesys Workspace Desktop Edition with Genesys Co-browse. This plug-in enables the agent to join and terminate a co-browsing session with a customer.</p></li>							
							<li><p><b>Genesys Widgets - </b> A set of productized widgets that are optimized for use with desktop and mobile web clients, and which are based on the GMS APIs. Genesys Widgets provide for an easy integration with Co-browse, allowing you to proactively serve these widgets to your web-based customers.</p></li>
							</ul>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Modes</h2>
							<p>Co-browsing sessions can be in either Pointer Mode or Write Mode</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
							<li><p><b>Pointer Mode</li></p></b>
							<p>While in Pointer Mode, the agent can see what the customer sees but the agent can not perform any actions in the customer's browser. The agent can not navigate, input information, or submit forms. The agent and the customer can see each other's mouse movements at all times and the agent's mouse clicks will create a red circle effect around their mouse pointer. The agent can use the red circle effect to point to specific sections on the web page and to direct the customer.</p>
							<p>Agents always join a Co-browse session in Pointer Mode.</p>
							<li><p><b>Write Mode</li></p></b>
							<p>In Write Mode, both the agent and the customer can perform conventional user actions. Both can enter text and click buttons. The agent can navigate by clicking links in the web page or by using the following navigation options in Agent Dektop: Back and forward arrows, URL bar or Refresh button</p>
							<p>Administrators can limit which interactive elements are enabled for an agent in Write Mode. For example, administrators may choose to disable certain links. By default, all Submit buttons are deactivated for agents and nothing will happen when an agent clicks one. Customers can always submit forms as if they were browsing normally.</p>
							</ul>

							<h2>The BIG Picture</h2>
							<p>There are only two components to deploy in your existing Genesys environment:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
							<li><p><b>Co-browse Server</li></p></b>
							<li><p><b>Redis DB</li></p></b>

							<h2>Intro</h2>
							<p>A co-browse session can only be initiated by a customer and on the websites which <a href="#ts">supports</a> co-browse. An agent does not have the option or ability to send a co-browse request to a customer. This provides greater security to the customer. In order to initiate a co-browse session, the customer must already be engaged in an interaction with an agent, be it a voice call or a chat so the customer can interact with the agent and browse over the co-browse session.</p>
							<p>When the session is established, the agent's browser displays a view of the customer's browser. The view the agent sees is loaded from Genesys Co-browse Server. The agent is not a client of the website. All actions taken by the agent are passed onto and "replayed" on the customer's (also referred to as the "Master") side.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>The session</h2>
							<p>Co-browse sessions are not interactions like chat and voice interactions. Co-browse sessions take place on top of a primary interaction like chat or voice and attach user data for reporting. Co-browse sessions do not support operations that are standard for Genesys interactions like transfer and conference.</p>
							<p>A session is initiated when a customer requests to co-browse. The session stays idle until the agent joins. Then the session is considered to be active. The session ends when one of the parties (the customer or the agent) exits. It is not possible to re-join a co-browse session. If one party exits accidentally, a new session must be initiated. Starting with Co-browse 8.5.003, an agent is by default limited to handling one co-browse session at a time.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Initiating a session</h2>
							<p>If a customer and agent are engaged in a voice call or external chat, a co-browse session can be initiated by the customer if the need arises. For example, the agent might be trying to walk the customer through how to submit a specific form, but the customer is having issues understanding where the agent is directing him or her to go on the page. In this scenario, the agent might suggest they engage in a co-browse session. While the agent can verbally suggest a co-browse session, the customer is the one who must initiate the session.</p>
							<p>By default, there is a "Co-browsing" button on the left side of every web page that supports co-browsing. Note that the location on the page can vary, depending on configuration.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Pictography</h2>
							<p>When the customer clicks the "Co-browsing" button, they are presented with a message window asking them to confirm that they are engaged in a voice call with a representative.</p>
							<img src ="img\CBS_1.png">
							<p>If the customer selects "No", a new message advises them to either initiate a voice call or a chat in order to co-browse.</p>
							<img src ="img\CBS_2.png">
							<p>If the customer selects "Yes", a numeric session identifier appears on the customer's screen.</p>
							<img src ="img\CBS_3.png">
							<p>This identifier can then be read to the agent over the phone or the customer might have to send the session ID through their external chat window. The agent enters the session identifier in the appropriate field in Workspace Desktop Edition, and then the customer's browser is displayed in the agent's view. There is no need to navigate to the web page the customer is viewing; the session identifier ensures the exact page is embedded in Workspace Desktop Edition for the agent. The customer is notified on his or her screen that the session has been established.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
						<h2>The Script</h2>
							<p>The customer must instrument their website to enable Genesys Co-browse. This means that every page accessible by the customers must include the Co-browse JavaScript code.</p>
							<p id="ts">The Co-browse JavaScript code can be added to the web pages of any website that uses mainstream web technologies, such as PHP, Java, or .NET. It's important to note that Co-browse does not set any limits on technologies used on both server and client sides, and can be integrated with any of them.</p>
							<p>Every page in the customer's website should have the below script added within the script tags before the closing of the "head" tag.</p>
							<div class="cbscript">
							<div align="left">(function(d, s, id, o) {<br />
									var fs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0], e;<br />
									if (d.getElementById(id)) return;<br />
									e = d.createElement(s); e.id = id; e.src = o.src;<br />
									e.setAttribute('data-gcb-url', o.cbUrl);<br />
									fs.parentNode.insertBefore(e, fs);<br />
									})(document, 'script', 'genesys-js', {<br />
									src: "<COBROWSE_SERVER_URL>/cobrowse/js/gcb.min.js",<br />
									cbUrl: "<COBROWSE_SERVER_URL>/cobrowse"<br />
									});
